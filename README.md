A collection of projects for building machine learning and AI models from scratch.

The purpose:

- To understand the inner working's of common machine learning models
- To better understand the underlying components and implementations of models as well as the calculations
- To gain a foundation in buidling models in order to better understand and be able to build future models
- Gain a firm grasp on foundational models before progressing into deep learning and neural networks
- To work with vectors, matrix's and common mathmetics/statistics related to machine learning
